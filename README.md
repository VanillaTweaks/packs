# Vanilla Tweaks Packs

This is the official repo for the source of some of the Vanilla Tweaks packs.

## Usage

You can build a data pack or a set of data packs using `poetry run build`.

Examples:
```sh
poetry run build datapacks/1.18/invisible_item_frames
poetry run build datapacks/1.18/*
poetry run build d*/1.18/*frame*
```

To continually watch the project and rebuild whenever files are changed, use `poetry run watch` in the same way.
